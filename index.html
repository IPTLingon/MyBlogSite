	<h1> MANIWAYA ISLAND </h1>
	<p> Maniwaya Island is an ideal place to laze on the beach and swim in the clear waters. Rent a boat and visit Palad Sandbar and Ungab Rock Formation. The sandbar is a good place to go swimming; sink your toes in the soft sand and relax. There are snorkeling spots where you can see some corals and marine life. </p>
